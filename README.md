# How we got here

## Version 1.0
* There were many version 1.0's.   This one held up the longest and was a solid, open-source template.  
### [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

## Version 2.0 (Engineering Sample)
* Statically generated website.   This setup is designed for one line startup.   
  ```
  "I just want to write some scss or modern js and see what happens."
  ```

* Gulp Build to compile scss and js (ES6+) source to /docs directory for deploy.   

* A whole bunch of absolutely positioned elements are going to be in these first few versions.   I think this mean i'm supposed to learn css grid.

* Apology for any speeling and gramar errors in the code base.
