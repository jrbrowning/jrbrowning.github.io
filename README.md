# How we got here

## Version 1.0
* There were many version 1.0's.   This one held up the longest and was a solid, open-source template.  
### [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/) - [Freelancer](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/freelancer/)

## Version 2.0 (Engineering Sample)
* Statically generated website.   This setup is designed for one line startup.   
  ```
  "I just want to write some scss or modern js and see what happens.   Don't make me think."
  ```

* Gulp Build to compile scss and js (ES6+) source to /docs directory for deploy.    Good seperation of development/production code via deploy.sh script...(shell scripts are the future)   

* A whole bunch of absolutely positioned elements are going to be in these first few versions.   I think this mean i'm supposed to learn css grid.

* I truly hope this is the first commit in a long tradition to returning code to the open source world.   People working for free ...because they believe in the cause now.  Incredible.  But open source code needs a maintaince budget.  This is how the lights stay on.

* Apology for any speeling and gramar errors in the code base.
